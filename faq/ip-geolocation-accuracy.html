    <h1>How accurate is IP geolocation?</h1>
    <div class="meta"><time datetime="2025-10-15">Updated: October 15, 2025</time> · by <a href="mailto:myipscan@gmail.com">Yaroslav Sabardak</a></div>

    <p>
      IP geolocation is <em>approximate</em>. It estimates where an IP address is likely located based on registry data, ISP allocations and network signals.
      Country accuracy is typically very high, while city-level precision varies by provider, network type and whether you use VPNs or mobile data. This guide explains how it works, why it’s sometimes wrong, and how to <strong>test and improve</strong> your results.
    </p>

    <h2>How IP geolocation works (in plain language)</h2>
    <p>
      Geolocation providers combine multiple inputs to infer location:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IP allocations &amp; registries:</strong> regional internet registries (like RIPE or ARIN) and ISP records indicate which organization owns an IP block and its service area.</li>
      <li><strong>Routing signals:</strong> BGP paths and ASN relationships suggest countries/regions where traffic enters and exits.</li>
      <li><strong>Network measurements:</strong> latency and path data hint at proximity to known network hubs.</li>
      <li><strong>User &amp; provider feedback:</strong> correction reports, enterprise inputs and periodic database refreshes refine results over time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      None of these signals pinpoints a street address; at best, they converge on a city or metropolitan area. That’s why IP geolocation should not be used for personal identity or precise physical tracking.
    </p>

    <h2>Typical accuracy ranges</h2>
    <table class="compare" summary="Typical IP geolocation accuracy by level and network type">

          <th>Typical accuracy</th>
          <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Country</td>
          <td>95–99%</td>
          <td>Usually correct unless traffic exits via another country (VPN/proxy).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Region / State</td>
          <td>80–90%</td>
          <td>Better near population centers; weaker for cross-border carriers.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>City / Metro</td>
          <td>60–80%</td>
          <td>Often maps to ISP’s hub city, not the subscriber’s neighborhood.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Postal / ZIP</td>
          <td>10–30%</td>
          <td>Rare and unreliable; sometimes resolves to data center or billing office.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mobile networks</td>
          <td>Variable</td>
          <td>May show carrier core locations far from the device.</td>

    </table>

    <h2>Why results can be wrong</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>VPNs and proxies:</strong> your traffic appears to originate from the exit server’s city/country.</li>
      <li><strong>Carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT):</strong> many users share one public IP that maps to the ISP gateway, not each home.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile routing:</strong> carriers may tunnel traffic through centralized gateways in another city or region.</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise networks:</strong> corporate egress points (data centers) mask branch office locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Data freshness:</strong> IP blocks get reassigned; databases lag behind if not updated frequently.</li>
      <li><strong>Hosting &amp; cloud IPs:</strong> often pinned to the provider’s facility, not the app’s end users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to check your IP location (quick test)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <a href="/tools/what-is-my-ip.html">What is my IP</a> to see your public IP and reported country/city.</li>
      <li>Run <a href="/tools/dns-lookup.html">DNS Lookup</a> to view resolvers (ISP vs. custom/VPN) and confirm consistency.</li>
      <li>If you use a browser-based VPN or collaboration tools, also try <a href="/tools/webrtc-leak-test.html">WebRTC Leak Test</a> to ensure the browser doesn’t reveal local/public IPs unexpectedly.</li>
      <li>Compare results on <strong>home Wi-Fi vs. mobile data</strong>; save screenshots for reference.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to improve geolocation accuracy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Avoid intermediaries</strong> during tests: disable VPN/proxy and private relay features.</li>
      <li><strong>Stabilize your setup:</strong> keep the same router/connection for a few days so databases can converge.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable IPv6</strong> if your ISP supports it; dual-stack paths can improve signal quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Check with your ISP:</strong> if your IP maps to the wrong city, ask whether your address block can be corrected in major databases.</li>
      <li><strong>For websites/apps:</strong> don’t rely on IP alone for critical flows; combine with user-granted GPS or billing/shipping info.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>1) Can IP geolocation identify my street address?</h3>
      <p>No. It estimates a general area (often a city or ISP facility). Personal addresses require user-granted data like GPS.</p>

      <h3>2) Why does my IP point to a different city every day?</h3>
      <p>Your ISP may use dynamic addressing, CGNAT or route changes; mobile networks also shift traffic among gateway locations.</p>

      <h3>3) My result is clearly wrong — how do I fix it?</h3>
      <p>Test without VPN/proxy, collect evidence (screenshots from different tools) and contact your ISP to request database updates.</p>
